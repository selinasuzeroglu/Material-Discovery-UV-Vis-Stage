# Material Discovery UV-Vis Stage Automation

## Description

This repository contains code for automating the movement of the Zaber stage, which carries sample holders, in the context of material discovery using UV-Vis spectroscopy. The code enables the following functionalities:

1. Automating the movement of the Zaber stage to position the sample holders accurately.
2. Utilizing a light sensor to detect the correct position and trigger actions accordingly.
3. Interfacing with Siemens PLC/Arduino boards to process the trigger signals.
4. Sending signals to the Zeiss spectrometer system for measurements.
5. Establishing communication between Siemens PLC/Arduino boards and the Zeiss spectrometer system.
6. Processing and analyzing measurement results from SQL using Python.
7. Automatic positioning of the Zaber stage to the camera position for capturing high-resolution images using a Nikon camera.
8. Triggering the Nikon camera automatically using a trigger mechanism.
9. Saving and analyzing the high-resolution images using PyTorch (https://github.com/selinasuzeroglu/PyTorch-Sample-Recognition).
