"""" 
We want to read/write datatype = bool (bit size = 1), because that allows us to read/write Digital Input/Output,
which operate either in ON(=TRUE/1) or OFF(=FALSE/O) mode.
Instead of directly operating with I/O of the PLC hardware, we create DataBlocks which represent the memory space inside 
the PLC. We use the DataBlocks for HMI communication (by way of Ethernet connection) to read/write memory space of/to 
I/O of the PLC hardware. By implementing condition statements between I/O and DataBlocks into TIA Program Blocks, 
we can control PLC I/O through Python.

Address Example for DataBlocks: DB1.DBX0.1
db_number = 1
start_offset = 0
bool_index = 1

reading memory bool:
client.db_read(db_number, start_offset, size)
size = 1 because we only need one byte for boolean (boolean_bitsize = 1 but PLC operates with minimum of byte datasize)

client.db_read gives bytearray of one byte length, e.g. client.db_read = bytearray([0b00000001])
snap7.util.get_bool(bytearray_: bytearray, byte_index: int, bool_index: int) â†’ bool
Get the boolean value from location in bytearray
